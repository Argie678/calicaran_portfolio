                <p class="blog-excerpt">Starting my web development journey was both exciting and overwhelming. I began with HTML and CSS, and slowly built my way up to JavaScript and backend basics...</p>
                <div class="full-content" style="display: none;">
                    <p>When I first started learning web development, my school provided a foundation in HTML and CSS, which gave me a structured approach to building websites. However, I wanted to deepen my understanding, 
                    so I explored online courses, documentation, and YouTube tutorials. The combination of formal education and self-guided learning helped me build my first static website, which was an incredibly rewarding experience.</p>
                    <p>After mastering the basics of front-end development, I moved on to JavaScript. The transition was challenging but exciting. I spent weeks understanding concepts like DOM manipulation and event listeners before feeling comfortable enough to build interactive elements.</p>
                    <p>Now I'm exploring backend development with Node.js and Express. The journey has been full of challenges, but every small victory keeps me motivated to learn more.</p>

                <div class="full-content" style="display: none;">
                    <h4>VS Code</h4>
                    <p>As my primary code editor, VS Code has been indispensable. Its extensions like Live Server and Prettier have significantly improved my workflow. The built-in terminal and Git integration make it perfect for web development.</p>
                    
                    <h4>GitHub</h4>
                    <p>Learning version control with GitHub was a game-changer. Not only does it help me manage my projects, but it's also become my portfolio platform. GitHub Pages lets me host my projects for free.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Figma</h4>
                    <p>Before writing any code, I now design my projects in Figma. This visual approach helps me plan better and catch design issues early. The collaborative features are perfect for team projects.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Google Drive</h4>
                    <p>For organizing my learning resources, notes, and project assets, Google Drive is my go-to. The cloud storage ensures I can access my files from anywhere, and the sharing features are great for collaboration.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Stack Overflow</h4>
                    <p>No developer works in isolation. Whenever I'm stuck, Stack Overflow has answers to almost every problem I've encountered. The community has saved me countless hours of frustration.</p>
